# Shepherd â€” Android GeckoView prototype

This folder contains a minimal GeckoView-based Android app prototype.

How to open
1. Open the android/ directory in Android Studio.
2. Ensure you have the Android SDK and a compatible JDK installed.
3. Add or update the GeckoView dependency to a valid release available in Mozilla's Maven repository.

Notes
- This prototype demonstrates a simple URL bar, navigation, and a GeckoView instance.
- For privacy hardening, we'll later add blocklist integration, privacy toggles, and options for Tor/proxy routing.
